    "A simple story: I thought I was going to have to write a scraper, but then the search page I was looking at had an export button that made a nice file that Excel opened up. It looked great, all the same text that was on my screen. I figured out how to dynamically generate that export button link so I could run it on a regular basis and schedule it.\n",

The exported file was missing something that was absolutely critical.\n",

You can run a raw import statement on it, but each time you'd have to type _pyquery.PyQuery(somethingsomething)_ and at that point you might as just try to cuddle a honey badger. Let's get in the habit of a different import statement that will mean we need a lot less typing. In fact, let's just use _pq_ to mean _pyquery.PyQuery_.
